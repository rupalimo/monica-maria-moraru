							<em>I Am Also Part of the Three Turns</em> traces the effects of a
							destructive earthquake in Bucharest and a concurrent flood it
							caused in a small town in Buzau, during a period of aggressive
							nationalistic urbanization in Communist Romania. Weaving between
							the allegorical and the archival, the film sketches a causal
							series of personal and political congruences throughout a
							patchwork of intertwined landscapes. Relying on oral and
							fragmentary archival histories, ‘I Am Also Part of the Three
							Turns’ teases out a temporally irresolute past that defies the
							linear cause-and-effect of both environmental disaster and
							authoritarian political repression.

						<p>
							Commissioned by Rupert Residency Centre,
							<em>Not an Hour</em> presents architectural form itself as a
							sensory organism, responding to the environment through cracks,
							hums, and reverberation. Vibrations transferred through steel
							plates tune the structure to both dissonant and harmonic
							resonances, in turn drawing subtle movement to the work’s fabric
							membrane. <em>Not An Hour</em> nods to both real and imagined
							political and architectural histories in specificity of the Baltic
							states’ post-Soviet context, tracing the legacy of structures
							which endure beyond past regimes to be recontextualized in
							contemporary political struggles.

							Integrating cast-glass sculptures, found objects, architectural
							scaffolding and multi-channeled sound, An Ant In The Mouth of a
							Furnace culminates into an experiential meditation on the
							phenomenological concerns of image-making. The site-specific
							installation was accompanied by a 4-channel sound work, arranged
							and scored with a film composer, culminating in a sensorial
							expression of a temporary architecture, at once reverent as a
							cathedral and provisional as a film set.
