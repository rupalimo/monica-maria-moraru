						Architectural form itself becomes a sensory organism in ‘Not An
						Hour’, a sculptural installation that folds sonic resonation into
						material form. Resonant frequencies emit vibrations through the
						structure’s steel plates, transferring subtle movements to a fabric
						membrane. A structural imposition activated as a sensorial tool,
						‘Not An Hour’ responds to the environment through cracks, hums, and
						sensorial vibration through both dissonance and harmony. The
						structure’s formal references to Sovietic brutalism nods to the
						political and architectural history of the Baltic states, as the
						shelled and hollowed plates offer a haunting evocation of the
						skeletal remains of past regimes.

					<p>
						Commissioned by Rupert Residency Centre, Not an Hour explores
						architectural form as sensory organism, in the specificity of the
						post-Soviet context. The structure was equipped with a vibrational
						resonator which made contact with the structure’s steel plates,
						subtly tuning the metal, in turn transferring subtle movements to
						the work’s fabric membrane. responding to the environment through
						cracks, hums, and sensorial vibrations.

						I Am Also Part of the Three Turns traces the effects of a
						destructive earthquake in Bucharest and a concurrent flood it caused
						in a small town in Buzau, during a period of aggressive
						nationalistic urbanization in Communist Romania. Weaving between the
						allegorical and the archival, the film sketches a causal series of
						personal and political congruences throughout a patchwork of
						intertwined landscapes. Relying on oral and fragmentary archival
						histories, ‘I Am Also Part of the Three Turns’ teases out a
						temporally irresolute past that defies the linear cause-and-effect
						of both environmental disaster and authoritarian political
						repression.

					<p>
						Integrating cast-glass sculptures, architectural scaffolding and
						multi-channeled sound, An Ant In The Mouth of a Furnace culminates
						into an architectural and experiential meditation on the
						phenomenological concerns of image-making. The site-specific
						installation was accompanied by a 4-channel sound work, arranged and
						scored with a film composer, culminating in a sensorial expression
						of an intimate architecture, at once reverent as a cathedral and
						provisional as a film set.
